# Java-Int-List-Operations

This project was an assignment of my CS 201 Data Structures Java course and implements a linked list of integers and features functional style programming.
The main goal of this project was not only to demmonstrate how linked lists and linked linked lists are commonly manipulated but also to use the common
functions such as prepend, append, postpend, reverse, etc., but use those in tandem to create more advanced linked list and linked linked list manipulations such
as:

filterSorted: Returns a list of all of the lists of L that are sorted. 
mapPrepend: Returns a new list that contains list elements in which i is prepended to every corresponding element of the input list.
subsequences: Given an integer list L, return a list of all the subsequences of L.
